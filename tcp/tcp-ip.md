What is the TCP/IP Model?
The TCP/IP model governs how data btw two different devices are transmitted over the communication channel. This network model is based on four different layer structure.
TCP/IP model is a method of sharing info and data over communication channel, but the data has to go through each of the four layers of the network model, where it perfroms tasks like remodeling of data, etc.
Each layer has dedicated protocols that they enact on the transmission data


Protocols Applied In the Model
Application Layer: FTP, HTTP, Telnet, SMTP..
Transport Layer: TCP & UDP
Internet Layer: IP, ICMP, ARP
Network Access Layer: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Cables..


Layers of the TCP/IP Model
The model is split into four different network layers, which dwfines the protocol applied on the data being transmitted over the communication channel.
1. Application Layer
   This layer is responsible for maintaining the protocols essentials for interaction btw the user and the application.
   This layer has an interface btw the application n program that require the TCP/IP model for communication including tasks performed by the layer such data representation for the software app that are executed by the user and then forward it to the transport layer
   PROTOCOLS:
   HTTP: used for accessing the info available on the internet.
   SMTP: assigned the task of handling e-mail related tasks.

2. Transport Layer
   This layer is responsible for establishing connection btw the sender and the receiver device, also provides suitable protocols in case an error occurs during the transmission of data.
   This layer perform the task of diving the data from application layer into packects where they're used to create sequences which are then transfered to the destination devices
   PROTOCOLS:
   TCP: Transnission Control Protocol is responsible for proper transmission of segments over the communication channel.
   UDP: User Datagram Protocol, which is responsible for identying errors, and other tasks during transmission of information.

3. Internet Layer
   This layer is responsible for sharing packets from the sender side to the destination side. This layer is also assigns a proper route for the data transmission
   PROTOCOLS:
   IP: This protocol assigns our device with a unique address, IP address, it is responsible for routing the data over the communication channel.
   ARP: This protocol refers to the Address Resolution Protocol that is responsible for finding the physical address using the IP address.

4. Network Access Layer (or Data Link & Physical Layer for Updated Model).
   This is the last layer of the TCP/IP model.
   It is the integration of data link layer and the physical layer of the OSI model.
   It is also responsible for smooth transmission of the data and files b/w the devices on the network channel (transmission is done through raw bits). from sender to receiver through binary digits


Advantages of TCP/IP Model
* Assigns an IP address to each system on the communication channel, so as to provide an identity to the network.
* Responsible for the deployment of protocols for solving network related problems.
* Enables systems from different networks and types to share data and information.
